            My educational background consist of Bachelorâ€™s degree in Business Management from Saint Joseph College for Women. Although I have a successful career as an ERP Systems Manager, I am looking for a new challenge. <strong>I love to solve problems.</strong> Whether it's finding the most elegant way to write a line of code, or hiking a Class 5 route, I enjoy pushing limits and discovering solutions.</p>
            <p>As a Web Development student, I continually find opportunities to prove my creativity, flexibility, and detailed-eye. </p>
